        <p>Welcome to the <b>Weather &amp; Task API</b> documentation. This API provides two
            powerful sets of endpoints designed to help developers integrate weather data and task
            management capabilities into their applications with ease. </p>
        <p>The Weather &amp; Task API provides two sets of functionalities</p>
        <ol id="ol_jts_btk_bfc">
            <li>A simple /weather endpoint for retrieving real-time weather by city. It’s ideal for
                apps that need to display live temperature, weather descriptions, or customize
                content based on location.</li>
            <li>A /tasks endpoints offer a full-featured task management system. Developers can: <ul
                    id="ul_n3x_q5k_bfc">
                    <li>
                        <p>Create, read, update, and delete tasks (CRUD)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Retrieve paginated task lists</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Perform partial updates (PATCH)</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Use query parameters for flexible data fetching</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Handle rate limits gracefully using standard HTTP headers</p>
                    </li>
                </ul></li>
        </ol>
        <p>This documentation is your complete guide to integrating and using the Weather &amp; Task
            API efficiently. Whether you’re building a weather widget or a productivity tool, you’ll
